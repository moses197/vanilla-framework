Web Components are a set of technologies that allow us to extend the standard set of HTML elements with additional elements.

The three main technologies are:

Custom elements
A way to extend HTML so that instead of having to build all our markup out of <div>, <input>, <span> and friends, we can build with higher-level primitives.
Shadow DOM
Extending custom elements to have their own separate DOM, isolating complex behavior inside the element from the rest of the page.
HTML templates
Extending custom elements with reusable markup blocks using the <template> and <slot> tags, for quickly generating complex layouts.
